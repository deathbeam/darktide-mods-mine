-- preset.lua
--
-- Curated bot personas. v0.22.8 pivots the underlying technique after
-- v0.22.0 through v0.22.7 all failed to make a synthetic profile actually
-- render as a Zealot: our name / archetype / talents mutations either
-- silently dropped (archetype), got overwritten downstream
-- (generate_random_name replaces profile.name), or applied to the profile
-- table without changing what the bot renders as. Tertium 4/5's source
-- (mods/183) proves that a working bot swap does NOT synthesize a
-- profile, it substitutes the whole profile parameter with a
-- fully-resolved real character profile from the backend cache. That is
-- what v0.22.8 does.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- HOW A PRESET APPLIES (v0.22.8 rewrite)
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- 1. On boot we hook ProfilesService:fetch_all_profiles. Every time the
--    game fetches your saved characters (which it does whenever the
--    character list is opened, and whenever we manually poke it after a
--    state change), we copy each returned profile into _profile_cache
--    keyed by character_id.
--
-- 2. Each preset in the catalogue has an optional source_character_id.
--    You bind it with /pil_preset_capture_char <preset_id> after
--    selecting the character you want the bot modeled on (typically a
--    Zealot with the loadout / talents / appearance you want the bot to
--    inherit).
--
-- 3. When a bot is about to spawn (BotSynchronizerHost:add_bot fires),
--    we resolve which preset that bot slot wants, look up the source
--    character in _profile_cache, deep-clone the cached profile, apply
--    name + voice overrides on the clone, and hand THAT profile to
--    add_bot instead of the default bot profile. Because the source
--    profile is a real backend character, it already has every field
--    Fatshark's spawn pipeline needs (archetype, talents, loadout,
--    visual_loadout, gestalts, unit_data, and so on), so nothing has to
--    be synthesized.
--
-- 4. Fatshark's spawn later calls ProfileUtils.generate_random_name on
--    the bot's profile, which by default replaces profile.name with a
--    random bot name. We hook that too: if profile.original_name is set
--    (we stamp it during the clone), we return it verbatim so the bot
--    keeps the preset's display name instead of getting a random one.
--
-- What Kaizen needs to do once, per preset:
--   /pil_preset_source_list           see your cached characters
--   /pil_preset_capture_char <preset> pin the currently-selected
--                                     character as the preset source
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- BINDING MODEL (unchanged from v0.22.0)
-- ===========================================================================
--
--   default preset   applies to EVERY bot slot. Debug / testing shortcut.
--                    /pil_preset_default sister_argenta = force her onto
--                    every bot in the party until cleared.
--   per-slot binds   /pil_preset_bind 2 sister_argenta = only bot in
--                    slot 2 uses this preset. Slots 1-6 per M.MAX_SLOTS
--                    in bots.lua. Higher slots need penance / Ordos
--                    unlocks.
--
-- The slot counter resets on StateLoading enter (Pilgrimage.lua's
-- on_game_state_changed handler calls M.reset_spawn_counter there,
-- since the DMF Lua VM actually persists across missions and the
-- counter would otherwise accumulate). Bot death + respawn edge case
-- within a single mission is still not handled (documented on
-- _spawn_counter below).

-- ===========================================================================
-- Profile copy notes (v0.22.10)
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- v0.22.8 deep-copied the entire cached profile and passed the clone to
-- add_bot. Crashed on mission load because a naive deep-copy strips
-- metatables from nested tables (item instances, archetype table), and
-- Fatshark's spawn pipeline later invoked methods on those metatable-less
-- tables which no longer had methods.
--
-- v0.22.9 shifted to a top-level shallow copy (nested tables kept their
-- metatables via shared references). Safer than deep-copy but replaced
-- Fatshark's own vanilla bot profile wholesale, which the spawn pipeline
-- may not expect (the vanilla profile carries cosmetic slots, body data,
-- and visual_loadout already set up correctly).
--
-- v0.22.10 follows Better Bots' proven pattern
-- (github.com/hummat/BetterBots/blob/main/scripts/mods/BetterBots/bot_profiles.lua):
-- MUTATE the vanilla profile in place, only overwriting the class-identity
-- fields we care about. Fresh {} containers for talents / loadout_item_data
-- so per-bot state is isolated; MasterItems entries and the archetype
-- table are shared by reference (BB does exactly this and it works).
-- The two helpers below serve that mutation path.

-- ===========================================================================
-- Sister Argenta preset (metadata only in v0.22.8)
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- The talents / loadout tables here are kept as informational reference
-- (they document what the "canonical" Sister Argenta build looks like)
-- but they are NOT applied to the bot in this version. The bot inherits
-- everything from the source character's real backend profile, which is
-- captured via /pil_preset_capture_char. Kaizen: build a Zealot with the
-- talents and loadout below and capture her as the source, and the bot
-- will render exactly like your character but named Sister Argenta with
-- the Judge Female voice.

-- ===========================================================================
-- Apply a preset onto the vanilla bot profile (v0.22.10 rewrite)
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- v0.22.8 crashed on mission load. Root cause diagnosed from the Fatshark
-- source (scripts/loading/profile_synchronizer_host.lua) and Better Bots
-- (github.com/hummat/BetterBots, bot_profiles.lua): a bot profile that
-- goes through add_bot is later JSON-packed for network sync, and the
-- pack path calls table.clone_instance on the profile. If our copy
-- stripped metatables from nested tables (item instances especially), a
-- later method call on those tables errors and the engine takes a hard
-- fault.
--
-- v0.22.9 shifted to a shallow copy of the top level (nested tables
-- stayed as shared references so metatables were preserved). That fixes
-- the metatable problem but discards Fatshark's own vanilla bot profile,
-- which has cosmetic/body/visual_loadout fields already set up correctly
-- and is what the spawn pipeline expects to receive.
--
-- v0.22.10 follows Better Bots' proven pattern: MUTATE the vanilla
-- profile in place, only overwriting the class-identity fields we care
-- about (archetype, gender, voice, talents, loadout, name). Every other
-- Fatshark-added field on the vanilla profile is preserved. Nested
-- tables that vary per bot (talents, loadout_item_data) get fresh {}
-- containers so same-preset bots don't share mutable state; item
-- objects and the archetype table are shared references (BB does this
-- and it works, because those tables are cache entries and treated as
-- read-only by the spawn pipeline).

    -- across sessions where Kaizen switched from Veteran (traitor
    -- captain outfit copied onto Argenta) to Skitarii (Pasqal's
    -- icon now takes on his Skitarii look). The initial render was
    -- correct; the substring-driven re-render was overwriting it
    -- with local player's live profile on every profile-updated
    -- event Fatshark fires for the local player.
    --
    -- Namespaced form `pilgrim_<preset>` has ZERO overlap with
    -- Fatshark UUIDs (which are hex + dashes, never contain
    -- "pilgrim"). Uniqueness per preset preserves the portrait
    -- cache key stability that v0.22.30 established is critical.
    -- No character_id in the game shares this prefix, so nothing
    -- else's profile_updated event can substring-match a Pilgrimage
    -- bot's request either.
    --
    -- Old (v0.22.62):
    -- v0.22.62: MANGLE with a per-preset suffix instead
    -- of copying the source's UUID verbatim.
    --
    -- Why: when a bot's source character IS one of Kaizen's own
    -- characters (e.g. SISTER_ARGENTA sourced from Kaizen's own
    -- Sororitas Veteran named Sister Argenta), the copied character_id
    -- equals Kaizen's currently-active character_id whenever he plays
    -- that same character. NPCLook's outer spawn_profile /
    -- portrait_ui / cutscene hook chain calls
    -- profile_matches_active_character(profile) with a plain
    -- character_id == local_player.character_id test; that returns
    -- true for the bot; NPCLook then applies the LOCAL player's live
    -- NPC-Look state to the bot (via live_visual.profile_with_active_look).
    -- Field report v0.22.61: Argenta wore Kaizen's exact live outfit
    -- including every extra slot in the intro cinematic, even after
    -- the v0.22.61 apply_source_to_profile fallback removal, because
    -- the cutscene path never touches the baked visual_loadout: it
    -- runs the profile through the LIVE UIProfileSpawner hook chain
    -- where NPCLook fires first and overwrites the loadout with the
    -- local-player look before our inner hook gets a chance to
    -- decorate with the stored preset look.
    --
    -- Suffix keeps character_id STABLE per preset so portrait_ui's
    -- request cache (portrait_ui.lua line 67, keyed on character_id
    -- via string concat) still deduplicates correctly. v0.22.30 tried
    -- BLANKING to nil, which broke the same cache: nil landed the
    -- request under a math.uuid() key and profile_updated could never
    -- find the same slot again to refresh. A stable non-nil string
    -- avoids both problems.
    --
    -- BB compat: BB's yield-guard checks name + is_local_profile +
    -- _bb_resolved (all set above) plus a non-nil character_id string.
    -- It doesn't validate the string against the backend, so a
    -- suffix-mangled id passes the same as the original.
    --
    -- With mangling in place: NPCLook sees a character_id that doesn't
    -- match the local player -> profile_matches_active_character
    -- returns false -> NPCLook returns the profile unchanged ->
    -- our inner hook then decorates with the stored preset look
    -- (or leaves the source's raw gear standing if no snapshot).
    -- This is one place, ONE mangle, covering cutscene + portrait +
    -- any future UI path that goes through NPCLook's chain.
    --
    -- The portrait hook _wrap_portrait_hook further below used to
    -- do the same mangle AT SPAWN TIME conditional on a fresh
    -- decoration; that path is now redundant but left in place as a
    -- second-layer no-op (its "base ~= suffix already applied?" is
    -- naturally idempotent for our suffix shape).

    -- 4. Defense-in-depth: our set_profile guard.
    --
    -- History:
    --   v0.22.2: hooked BotPlayer.set_profile to block Fatshark's
    --   network-sync overwrites within a 10-second post-apply window,
    --   defending the sentinel field.
    --   v0.22.10: profile substitution moved to add_bot; the "network
    --   sync overwrites our field mutations" scenario became less
    --   common because the substituted profile has a real
    --   character_id the backend accepts. Guard kept as
    --   defense-in-depth.
    --   v0.22.64 (2026-08-09): REMOVED the time window and now block
    --   PERMANENTLY. Field diagnosis: with v0.22.62's character_id
    --   mangling in place, the cutscene renders bots correctly, but
    --   the party portrait icons still show the local player's look
    --   for class-matched bots (Argenta while Kaizen plays Veteran).
    --   Timing hypothesis: the intro cutscene resolves within the
    --   10-second post-apply window, so NPCLook's outer hook sees
    --   the mangled character_id and bails. The party HUD portrait
    --   however is a persistent element that also gets refreshed
    --   AFTER a later network-sync-driven set_profile call replaces
    --   our mangled profile with an unmangled Fatshark-canonical
    --   one; that call gets through the old 10-second guard because
    --   we're past the window. The HUD then re-requests the portrait
    --   with the now-unmangled character_id, NPCLook's outer hook
    --   sees class-match, and applies the local player's live look.
    --   Result: correct cutscene, wrong icon.
    --
    -- Fix: any set_profile call that would replace a
    -- `_pilgrimage_preset`-sentinel profile with an incoming profile
    -- lacking the same sentinel is dropped, regardless of how long
    -- ago the last apply was. Pilgrimage OWNS the bot's profile for
    -- the duration of the run; nothing else should be handing that
    -- bot a different profile. This is the correct semantic anyway
    -- (Fatshark's re-sync of a bot slot mid-run would erase the
    -- preset content — voice, name, loadout, everything, not just
    -- character_id — even without this bug).

    -- profile_matches_active_character check, and blanking it was
    -- actively harmful: portrait_ui uses character_id as its request
    -- cache key (portrait_ui.lua line 67), so a nil character_id landed
    -- the request under a math.uuid() prefix and profile_updated could
    -- never find it again to refresh. That's why v0.22.29 portraits
    -- showed a stale wrong-loadout render with no NPC Look overlay.
    --
    -- Fix: for a profile carrying our _pilgrimage_preset sentinel with a

    -- (happens when `profile_matches_active_character` returns true,

    -- mangling was supposed to prevent this, but there is at least
    -- one code path where NPCLook still ends up applying the active
    -- look: their `profile_with_look` sets
    -- `copy.npclook_source_profile = source_profile` on the decorated
    -- table as their own marker for "the original undecorated
    -- profile", per NPCLook.lua line 6762), then the profile we
    -- receive is a shallow-copy of the source with
    -- `loadout = add_look_to_loadout(source_loadout, LOCAL_PLAYER_STATE)`
    -- already baked in. If we then call
    -- `npclook_profile_with_look(that_decorated_profile, stored)` it
    -- OVERLAYS the stored preset look on top of Kaizen-flavour
    -- source_loadout — slots the stored snapshot covers get overwritten
    -- cleanly, but slots the stored snapshot does NOT cover keep
    -- Kaizen's overlay. That's the "Argenta icon shows Kaizen" bleed

    -- same character_id X, load_profile_portrait finds the existing
    -- request and REUSES Kaizen's cached data instead of rendering the
    -- bot. That's why v0.22.29 icons showed a wrong loadout with no
    -- NPC Look overlay — they were the local player's stale portrait.
    --
    -- Fix: for our bots, mangle character_id to a preset-specific
    -- variant (raw_id .. "_pilgrim_" .. preset_id). PortraitUI keys
    -- solely on character_id via string concat, so any suffix breaks
    -- the collision without affecting anything else.
    --
    -- v0.22.62 (2026-08-09): apply_source_to_profile now writes the
    -- suffix at PROFILE CREATION time (with the exact same shape),
    -- so most calls into this wrapper already carry a mangled id and
    -- the append below would double-mangle. Made idempotent: skip
    -- the extra append if the id already ends with our per-preset
    -- suffix. Also: the analogous "we don't need this for the
    -- spawn_profile / cutscene path" claim in v0.22.30 turned out to
    -- be wrong (NPCLook's outer spawn_profile hook DOES read
    -- character_id to decide whether to overlay the local-player
    -- look), which is exactly why apply_source_to_profile now bakes
    -- the mangle in universally. This wrapper is kept as a
    -- second-layer safety net that costs nothing.
    -- v0.22.67: apply_source_to_profile writes the pure
    -- `pilgrim_<preset>` form at bot creation, so this wrapper's own
    -- character_id rewrite becomes: if the incoming character_id
    -- ISN'T already the namespaced form (defensive), rewrite it in
    -- place. Idempotent on the new shape.
