-- shop.lua
--
-- The Emporium: where Ordos become gameplay. v1 ships consumable run modifiers
-- (curse reroll, curse skip, extra boon draft) plus the permanent-unlock
-- plumbing that the Majoris pool and cosmetic system will fill in later.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- Before this, Ordos accumulated forever with nothing to spend them on. Every
-- Novitiate clear dropped ~250 into a pile you could look at and nothing else.
-- The shop turns that pile into a decision surface.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- TWO KINDS OF PURCHASE
-- ===========================================================================
--
--   consumable   Buys a flag stored in _shop_consumables. Consumed by the
--                gameplay system it affects (launcher for curse reroll/skip,
--                bootstrap's pending_draft for extra slot) at the moment it
--                takes effect, then cleared. Also wiped whenever a run ends.
--
--   permanent    Buys a flag stored in _shop_unlocked. Persists across runs
--                forever. v1 ships the plumbing but no actual permanent SKUs,
--                because those need the Majoris pool and the loadout slots
--                to land first.
--
-- Some SKUs are penance-gated instead of Ordos-priced: the shop shows them as
-- "Locked, complete X" rather than a price tag. The unlock is still stored in
-- _shop_unlocked, but the transaction bypasses the wallet.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- STORAGE
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- Two comma-separated lists in settings, same encoding as _penances_earned.
-- All ids are validated against the catalogue on load so a stale saved id
-- from a removed SKU does not silently linger.
