-- curses.lua
--
-- Every leg of a pilgrimage carries a curse: one of the game's own mission
-- circumstances, assigned when the route is generated and shown in the preview before
-- you commit. Same seed, same gauntlet.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Why circumstances
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Darktide already ships the whole system: darkness, toxic gas, hunting grounds,
-- ventilation purge, the Havoc mutators, and so on, each a named template with its own
-- localization, icon and spawn logic. The launcher already threads a circumstance name
-- into the mission context. So a curse costs us a NAME, not a system.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Curation policy, per Kaizen
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Buff the enemy or change the conditions. NEVER debuff the player.
--
-- Havoc's explicit modifiers (tox gas, cranial corruption, stimmed minions...) are
-- fine and popular; its implicit rank scaling (less ammo from crates, lower health and
-- toughness) is disliked and is deliberately absent. Conveniently the implicit scaling
-- is not a circumstance at all, it lives in the Havoc rank system, so it cannot leak in
-- through this file. The two circumstances that DO reproduce it,
-- mutator_increased_difficulty and mutator_highest_difficulty, are excluded on purpose.
--
-- Also excluded:
--   * _less_resistance / _more_resistance variants: same curse, different enemy
--     budget. The base version is the curse; density is the danger setting's job.
--   * twins / expedition / solo variants: tied to specific mission scripting.
--   * cosmetic reskins (noir, dawn, ember, hub events): a curse must change play.

-- v0.22.92: Pilgrimage's own curses. Registered into the game's live
-- CircumstanceTemplates table the moment it arrives, so pool(),
-- stack_curses() and the launcher treat them exactly like vanilla
-- circumstances. Zero mutators, nil ui: the same field-proven shape as
-- the health-modifier-only stacked circumstance. Their EFFECTS live
-- Pilgrimage-side, keyed on the curse name being in the run's curse
-- prefix (The Serpent Below: traitor-bot friendly fire policy in
-- Pilgrimage.lua).

-- MUTATOR templates, registered into the game's live MutatorTemplates
-- aggregator the same way the curse circumstances register below.
--
-- Why: our "Shambling Pyres" curse pointed at the vanilla circumstance
-- common_minion_on_fire, whose mutator (mutator_common_minions_on_fire)
-- is class mutator_modify_havoc. That class's init calls
-- game_mode():extension("havoc"):init_horde_buff(), and the "havoc"
-- extension only exists in the Havoc game mode, so ANY normal mission
-- carrying it crashed at load ("attempt to index a nil value",
-- mutator_modify_havoc.lua:11). Repeatable, map-independent.
--
-- The replacement delivers the same fantasy through MutatorBase's own
-- per-spawn machinery: random_spawn_buff_templates applies the vanilla
-- common_minion_on_fire BUFF to walker breeds as they spawn
-- (mutator_base.lua line 208: breed_chance > math.random(), so 1 =
-- always), no havoc extension involved.

-- The catalogue
--
-- severity 1 is a nuisance, 2 changes how you play the leg, 3 is the reason the run
-- ends. label is the DISPLAYED name and always wins: several of these circumstances
-- ship with dev-placeholder localization ("Circumstance more specials"), so the
-- game's own strings cannot be trusted. Localize is only a fallback for names
-- outside this catalogue.
--
-- havoc = true marks entries borrowed from Havoc's template file. They are ordinary
-- circumstances structurally, but they have only ever shipped inside Havoc missions,
-- so they are the most likely to misbehave in a normal one. The setting
-- curses_havoc_pool switches them off in one place if they do.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Labels are the names players already know, taken from the mission board, the
-- Maelstrom modifier lists and the Havoc UI, verified against the circumstance
-- templates (which mutators each internal name actually runs). Three of these
-- circumstances (snipers, poxwalker bombers, mutants) never shipped standalone;
-- in the game files they borrow Hunting Grounds' entire UI block, so their
-- "known" names come from the shipped conditions built on the same mutators.
-- v0.20.3: catalogue expansion.
--
-- Three flag kinds sit on each entry:
--   havoc      This is a Havoc rotator (mutator_havoc_*). Always present in
--              the game. Gated by curses_havoc_pool setting.
--   live_event This came from a live-event template. May or may not still
--              have working mutators in the current shipping build; the
--              template exists (so M.pool() returns it), but individual
--              mutators inside it may be retired. Gated by
--              curses_live_event_pool. Set to false to isolate tests.
--
-- The v0.20.3 rebalance also moves Ventilation Purge and Shambling Pyres
-- down from severity 2 to severity 1 (Kaizen: "the more cosmetic ones
-- should go into tier ones"), and adds Dawn (`dawn_circumstance_template`,
-- pure lighting shift, zero mutators) as another tier 1 filler. Noir was
-- considered but pulled: black-and-white filter is severe enough to sit
-- behind a penance-unlock in the future permanent-unlock pool.

-- consult what legs N+1... would draw, and must be reproducible from the

-- always lands on the same replacement.
--
-- The re-seed mixes the run seed with the leg number and a distinct salt
-- so a reroll cannot happen to produce the SAME curse the leg already had
-- unless the pool is degenerate at that severity.
-- v0.20.3: takes the same (min_tier, max_tier) the run's plan uses, so
-- a reroll on Novitiate cannot accidentally hand you a tier-3 curse.

-- shouldn't be picked (curses already present in the run's queue).

-- Faith was already the prior leg's curse; letting the reroll produce
-- a duplicate defeats the purpose of stacking. Now we walk the tier
-- from severity down and skip any candidate whose name is in the

-- Stacking
--

-- runs its own curse PLUS the mutators of assignments 1 and 2.
--
-- The engine gives a mission exactly ONE circumstance slot, but the slot is not
-- the limit: MutatorManager._load_mutators has a Havoc branch that walks a LIST
-- of circumstances and appends every template's mutators into one load
-- (mutator_manager.lua:30-42). Stacking multiple circumstances' mutators is a
-- supported engine path; only the front door takes a single name.
--
-- So we go through the front door with a SYNTHETIC circumstance: before each
-- launch, register a template under our own name whose mutator list is the
-- deduped union of every curse up to the current assignment, wearing the CURRENT
-- curse's ui/audio/dialogue (the newest curse defines the leg's ambience).
-- Registration mutates the CircumstanceTemplates table itself, which is safe and
-- sufficient because require caches: the table we received through the fanout is
-- the same object MutatorManager reads (mutator_manager.lua:3). One reusable
-- name, re-registered before every launch, because only one mission runs at a
-- time, and re-registered on demand after a game restart because the launcher
-- asks for it on every resume.
