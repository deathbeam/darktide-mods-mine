-- terminal.lua
--
-- The physical entry point to a pilgrimage: a prop in a side alcove of the Mourningstar
-- that shows a marker from across the room, a prompt when you walk up to it, and opens
-- the route view when you press the interact key.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHY THIS IS HAND-ROLLED INSTEAD OF USING THE GAME'S INTERACTION SYSTEM
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- The obvious approach is to attach an InteracteeExtension to the prop and let the
-- vanilla system do everything: prompt, hold-to-activate, animation. That cannot work
-- here, and it is worth writing down why so nobody tries it again.
--
-- InteractorExtension finds what you are looking at with exactly two physics queries,
-- both against the collision filter "filter_interactable_overlap":
--
--     interactor_extension.lua:443  PhysicsWorld.raycast(... "collision_filter", FILTER)
--     interactor_extension.lua:486  physics_world:immediate_overlap(... "collision_filter", FILTER)
--
-- Only AFTER a physics hit does it ask whether the unit has an interactee extension
-- (line 515). /pil_look already proved this prop returns zero hits under that filter, so
-- it can never become the chosen target no matter what extension we attach. The
-- extension would be dead weight.
--
-- It would also be actively dangerous. The interaction target lives in a NETWORKED
-- component (player_unit_data_component_config.lua:975), so a client-only extension
-- means another machine can receive a target unit it has no extension for, and the very
-- next method call on it errors.
--
-- So: our own marker, our own prompt, our own key poll. We lose the vanilla hold ring
-- and the interact animation. We gain something that cannot desync and does not depend
-- on the prop's physics.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHAT WE DO USE FROM THE GAME
-- ===========================================================================
--
--   * the real world marker system, so the floating icon is the genuine article rather
--     than something drawn by us:
--         Managers.event:trigger("add_world_marker_position", type, position, cb, data)
--     "hub_objective" is the template the Mourningstar itself uses for points of
--     interest (hud_element_mission_objective.lua:38). It fades out as you approach,
--     which is exactly right: the marker gets you there, the prompt takes over.
--
--   * the real input service, so the key we watch is whatever the player actually has
--     bound to interact, including on a controller:
--         Managers.input:get_input_service("Ingame"):get("interact_pressed")

local FALLBACK_POSITION = { 26.4974, -109.6011, 99.8750 }

-- HEIGHT, and why the first build got it wrong.
--
-- Unit.world_position returns the unit's ORIGIN, which for a wall-mounted prop is its
-- pivot, and that pivot sits on the floor. The probe data proves it: the prop origin is
-- z = 99.8750, the camera was at z = 102.2223, so the origin is roughly 2.3m below eye
-- level, which is below the player's feet. The first version anchored the prompt there,
-- and it appeared lying on the ground.
--
-- The right answer is the prop's visual centre, which the engine will tell us:
--
--     local pose, extents = Unit.box(unit)     -- oriented bounding box
--     Matrix4x4.translation(pose)              -- its centre
--
-- HEIGHT and HORIZONTAL are blended SEPARATELY, along the same line from the prop's
-- origin to its bounding box centre, because the two axes wanted opposite corrections.
--
--     0.0  the origin, the prop's authored pivot
--     1.0  the bounding box centre
--
-- HEIGHT: 0.5. The origin sat on the floor, the box centre sat too high, halfway reads
-- correctly. Confirmed in game.
--
-- HORIZONTAL: 2.0, which is the box centre again as far beyond it as the origin is before
-- it. This is Kaizen's correction, and it is worth spelling out why it is not a guess.
-- Three observations pin the axis down:
--
--     at the origin (1.0 -> 0.0)   the prompt was OUT through the doorway
--     at the box centre (1.0)      it was in the middle of the room, needed to go deeper
--     the terminal                 is deeper still, in the alcove
--
-- So origin, box centre and terminal lie on one line in that order, and moving from the
-- box centre to the origin was a step in exactly the wrong direction. Reversing that step
-- from where it started is 2.0. The pivot being at the outer end of a prop that extends
-- inward is an ordinary way to author one; nothing about it is surprising once the sign
-- is known.

-- ===========================================================================
-- STOP GUESSING AT THE ANCHOR
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- Three attempts have now been made to derive this position from data, and all three were
-- wrong in a different direction: the unit origin put the prompt on the floor, the box
-- centre put it in the middle of the room, and origin-with-blended-height pushed it out
-- through the doorway.
--
-- The mistake underneath all three is the same. I kept treating Unit.world_position as
-- "where the terminal is". It is where the prop's PIVOT is, and for a ten-mesh prop
-- authored into an alcove the pivot can be anywhere, including outside the room. There is
-- no derivation from the unit that reliably lands on the face a player looks at.
--
-- So the anchor is now something you SET by looking at it. /pil_terminal_set fires the
-- same raycast the probe uses and takes the impact point, which is by definition on the
-- surface you are aiming at. That point is stored as an OFFSET from the unit origin, not
-- as an absolute coordinate, so it still follows the prop if a patch moves it.
--
-- The blend below stays as the default for a fresh install, since something has to show
-- before anyone has aimed at anything.
--
-- Note for later: probe.look_at reports hit.position as Unit.world_position(unit, 1),
-- which is the unit ORIGIN, not the impact point. That is precisely why the coordinate I
-- read out of look.txt and treated as "the terminal" was nothing of the sort. The impact
-- point has to be computed from the ray: origin + forward * hit.distance.

-- The marker's landlord just changed, and our lease went with it.
--
-- This is the fix for the marker being missing on a fresh boot and only appearing
-- after a mission. The timeout above was built for the case where the add EVENT went
-- unanswered. The real failure was crueller: the add WAS answered. World markers live
-- inside HudElementWorldMarkers, in plain tables on the element instance
-- (hud_element_world_markers.lua:31), and the game builds that element more than once
-- while a level settles. Our add landed in an early instance, the callback delivered a
-- real id, and then the element was torn down and rebuilt, taking every stored marker
-- with it. We sat holding a valid-looking id for a marker that no longer existed,
-- refusing to add another. After a mission the timing happens to put our add after the
-- final rebuild, which is why it "worked" then, and only then.
--
-- So: Pilgrimage.lua hook_safes the element's init through the same fanout mechanism
-- every other class hook uses, and a new instance being born means every id we hold is
-- void. Drop them and let the tick re-add against the instance that is actually on
-- screen. The request flag drops too, because a callback owed by a dead element is
-- never coming.

-- instance, forever. On the very next frame _update_view_hotkeys calls
-- allow_close_hotkey_for_view, which does `view_instance:allow_close_hotkey()` with no
-- nil guard, and the game hard crashes.
--
-- The first version wrapped open_view in a bare pcall. That caught the real Lua error,
-- discarded the message, returned a tidy "false" to the caller, and left the game in
-- that poisoned state. A clean, diagnosable error became a crash with no explanation.

-- path, so require fell through to the engine, which has no such bundled file.
