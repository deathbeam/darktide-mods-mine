-- chain.lua
--
-- Turns a queue of missions into a run: detect that a leg ended, record how it ended,
-- and launch the next one.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHERE THE OUTCOME COMES FROM
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- game_mode_manager.lua:381-411. Every frame the manager asks the game mode whether
-- the run is over, and on the first yes it records the outcome and announces it:
--
--     local end_conditions_met, outcome = game_mode:evaluate_end_conditions()
--     if end_conditions_met then self:_set_end_conditions_met(outcome) end
--
--     GameModeManager._set_end_conditions_met = function (self, outcome)
--         self._end_conditions_met = true
--         self._end_conditions_met_outcome = outcome
--         ...
--         Managers.mechanism:trigger_event("game_mode_end", outcome, session_id)
--
-- We hook `_set_end_conditions_met` with hook_safe, so we observe the outcome without
-- being able to interfere with it. Outcome values come from
-- NetworkLookup.game_mode_outcomes; we treat anything that is not a win as a loss
-- rather than hardcoding the vocabulary.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHY WE DO NOT LAUNCH IMMEDIATELY
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- End conditions fire while you are still standing in the level, before the outro
-- cinematic and the end-of-round screen. Tearing the session down at that moment
-- would cut off the cinematic Kaizen confirmed plays correctly.
--
-- So we RECORD the outcome, let the game do its normal end sequence all the way back
-- to the Mourningstar, and launch the next leg from there. That gives:
--
--     play -> outro_win -> end screen -> Mourningstar -> next leg loads
--
-- which is the chapter-break feel, and it uses the game's own flow rather than
-- fighting it.
